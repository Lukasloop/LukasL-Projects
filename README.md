# [Project 1: Multiple Linear Regression GUI](https://github.com/Lukasloop/Multiple-Linear-Regression-GUI)
* Created a GUI that uses the KC House Data, which is a dataset of houses sold between 2014 and 2015 and is available at https://www.kaggle.com/shivachandel/kc-house-data, for Multiple Linear Regression.
* This tool loads in the Excel-File, analyzes the data and preprocesses it. Then, the data will be feeded into the Multiple Linear Regression algorithm, will be trained and tested.
* Subsequently you will be able to make predictions of the house price of an insertable input.
